# Tutelage

Tutelage was borne from the crazy idea of trusting teachers and empowering students.

Tutelage seeks to empower learners by providing them with an affordable platform that matches them with a licensed teacher in their desired area of study and taps into the often- undervalued talent of teachers beyond the classroom.
